# Different types of Numbers in python
# Python has different types of numeric values or literal
# For example integers 2 ,-2 etc
# Floating point numbers float 3.272 or 100.0
# if we put a floating point with an integer it will be called floating point number for example 2.0,100.0
# floating point number does not matter if it has 0 after 100 or whatever
# Now let's discuss some basic arithematic operations
a=1
b=6
c=a+b
print(c) # Addition
a=7
b=3
c=a-b
print(c) # Substraction
a=7
b=3
c=a*b
print(c) # Multiplcation
a=7
b=4
c=a/b
print(c) # Division
a=7
b=4
c=a//b
print(c) #Floor Division
# Here what floor division does is it ignores the decimal part or in other words it trucates it without rounding
# So what would be the modulo let's see it actually give us the reminder
a=7
b=4
c=a%b
print(c) #Reminder
#Now how to take powers in python you just can use the multiplication operator twice to do that
print(2**3)
# Order of operations followed in python
print(2+10*10+3) #it first multiply than add other values
# You can use paranthesis to specify orders like
print((2+10)*(10+3)) #Now the answer would be different
# Let's talk about variables we sometimes call them objects as they are built in classes that we create objects of
# We will learn more about it you just have to stay with me
# We can assign different values to the variable
# Let's do it then
a=10
# Let's print it using the function print
print(a)
# you can also do some basic arithematic operation on these variables
# Let's do that too
a=a+a
print(a)
